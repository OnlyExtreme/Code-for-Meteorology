## Python Codes for NUS PC3441 Numerical Methods for Meteorology

The repository contains following contents (up to now):

1. **Fourier Analysis**: Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, DFT, FFT.
2. **Filters**: Designing filters.
3. **PCA**: PCA with artifitial (or maybe real world data for sea level)

The codes mostly use Numpy and Matplotlib libraries for maths and graphs.

## Data Files

The following `.nc` data files are used in the analysis but are not included in the repository due to their large size.

*   `slp.mon.mean.nc`: [Download Link](https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis/Monthlies/surface/slp.mon.mean.nc)
*   `air.mon.mean.nc`: [Download Link](https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis/Monthlies/pressure/air.mon.mean.nc)
