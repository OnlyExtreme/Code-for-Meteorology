## Python Codes for NUS PC3441 Numerical Methods for Meteorology

The repository contains following contents (up to now):

1. **Fourier Analysis**: Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, DFT, FFT.
2. **Filters**: Designing filters.
3. **PCA**: PCA with artifitial (or maybe real world data for sea level)

The codes mostly use Numpy and Matplotlib libraries for maths and graphs.
